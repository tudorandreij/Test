```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution:

```{r}
x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(x)
hist(log(x))
lx <- log(x)
```


The mean is:
```{r}
mean(x)
```

The variance is:
```{r}
var(x)
```

The mean of the log-transformed distribution is:

```{r}
mean(lx)
```

The variance of the log-transformed distribution is:

```{r}
var(lx)
```
